# Multi-Language Static Code Analyzer in C++

A modular static code analysis tool built from scratch in C++ that parses source code, builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and finds potential bugs in **C++, Java, and Python**.

This project was developed as a deep dive into compiler front-end principles. It features a fully extensible architecture, intelligent analysis rules, and a professional, user-friendly HTML report generator.


* **True Multi-Language Support:** A single, extensible architecture that fully supports:
    * **C++:** Parses functions, `if` statements, and variable declarations.
    * **Java:** Reuses C++'s parsing logic for a similar syntax.
    * **Python:** Features a custom, stateful tokenizer that handles indentation-based scoping.

* **Advanced Rule-Based Analysis:** The analyzer walks the AST to find complex issues, including:
    * **True Unused Variable Detection:** Intelligently finds variables that are declared but *never* used (e.g., it correctly identifies `x` as "used" in an `if (x)` check).
    * **Unused Function Detection:** Scans for declared functions that are never called within their scope.

* **Professional HTML Reporting:** Generates a dynamic, color-coded HTML report that displays the full source code and highlights the exact lines with issues:
    * **Red highlighting** for unused variables.
    * **Green highlighting** for unused functions.

* **Full Compiler Front-End:** Implements the complete pipeline:
    1.  **Tokenizer:** A custom regex-based tokenizer for C++/Java and a stateful, indentation-aware tokenizer for Python.
    2.  **Parser:** Language-specific parsers that build a single, generic Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
    3.  **Analyzer:** A single, generic analyzer that traverses the AST, making it language-agnostic.
    4.  **Reporter:** A flexible reporter that can output to the console or the polished HTML file.
    5.  **Dispatcher:** A routing module that detects the file type and sends it to the correct pipeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build and Run

This project is built using g++.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd Static-Code-Analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create a build directory and compile:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    
    # This command includes all C++, Java, and Python modules
    g++ -std=c++17 -I../include ../src/main.cpp ../src/Tokenizer.cpp ../src/Parser.cpp ../src/Analyzer.cpp ../src/Reporter.cpp ../src/Dispatcher.cpp ../src/JavaTokenizer.cpp ../src/JavaParser.cpp ../src/PythonTokenizer.cpp ../src/PythonParser.cpp -o static_analyzer
    ```

3.  **Run the analyzer:**

    * **To get a console report:**
        ```bash
        ./static_analyzer ../samples/test.cpp
        ```
    * **To generate the professional HTML report:**
        ```bash
        ./static_analyzer ../samples/test.cpp --format html
        ```
        (This will create a `report.html` file in your `build/` directory.)

## ‚ú® Example (C++)

Given the following code in `samples/test.cpp`:
```cpp
int unusedHelper() {
    return 5;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;

    if (x) { // 'x' is used!
        int z = 30;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
The tool will generate an HTML report highlighting line 1 (unused function) in green and lines 10 & 13 (unused variables) in red, with a summary table of all issues.
